# URLShortner
URLShortner by using Python and Django

1. When we need to use this URLShortner we need to put the files and folder into your storage space
2. Then we need to run the django, if not installed install by using 'pip install django'
3. After installing the django run the codes by using the 'python manage.py runserver'
4. After that you will get the localhost link into your terminal
5. Copy that and paste it into your browser
6. Then it will run the all codes of the URLShortner
7. Thank for using my URLShortner file.
